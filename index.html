                    Project Learning Is For Everyone (Project LIFE) is a non-profit organization
                    whose primary initiative is to support a career-networking corridor between
                    DeKalb County professionals and high school seniors. Crafted by founders,
                    India Ali, Omari Crawford,and Jason Little—proud DeKalb County School
                    System graduates, Project Life was established to help support the enhancement
                    of career interests of high school seniors in DeKalb County Schools through
                    career-focused training and mentorship. DeKalb County has an esteemed
                    history of graduating talented and equipped professionals who continue to
                    add value in competitive industries worldwide.
                </p>
                <p class="we_text-p">
                    Ali, Crawford, and Little believe the students of DeKalb County are fully capable
                    of emerging as global industry leaders; however, as high school seniors approach
                    the next chapter of their lives, career exposure is pivotal. Project LIFE aims to assist
                    DeKalb County high school seniors achieve their career goals by surrounding them
                    with a broader network of supporters.
                </p>

                <p class="we_text-p">
                    At its fundamental principle, Project LIFE focuses on offering volunteer service to
                    help high school seniors as we aid them with gaining a foundational understanding
                    of their desired professions. Project LIFE will work with designated points of contact
                    within DeKalb County Schools to manage protocols, establish and maintain structured
                    student-to-professional dialogue for career information. As authorized, the team
                    at Project LIFE will create opportunities for students to gain early career-driven
                    experiences by pairing them with DeKalb County professionals who will offer
                    structured, career-based supplemental instruction through ongoing mentorship and training.

                <p class="we_text-p">
                    Project LIFE will offer annual scholarships to a select group of students through
                    an internal competitive application process. At the beginning of the spring semester,
                    Project LIFE will release an application package to high school seniors enrolled in
                    DeKalb County schools. DeKalb County seniors—who participated in extra—curricular
                    activities during their high school careers— are eligible for Project LIFE's competitive
                    scholarship. Once selected, students will receive a monetary scholarship and the
                    opportunity to pair with an experienced DeKalb County professional of their specific
                    career interest. This collaborative pairing supports Project LIFE's aim to foster
                    meaningful relationships between scholarship recipients and DeKalb County
                    professionals.
                </p>
                <p class="we_text-p">
                    Project LIFE wholeheartedly believes that every student can succeed. We are
                    committed to helping students achieve their career goals by extending our support
                    to help build and expand their pool of resources. Recognizing the tremendous
                    number of accomplished students who hail from The DeKalb County School System,
                    it is evident that students are equipped with the necessary tools to become life-long
                    learners and productive leaders far beyond our local community. Project LIFE will
                    passionately serve to assist students with achieving their future career goals.
